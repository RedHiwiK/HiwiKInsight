# Metrics

HiwiKInsight ships 15 built-in metrics with fixed definitions (`internal/metrics`). The same code serves the dashboard, the [query API](query-api.md), the [CLI](cli.md), MCP and the email reports, so a number means the same thing everywhere. The definition text below is exactly what the API returns in `definition` and what `describe` lists.

## Common parameters and conventions

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `app` | first configured app | App key |
| `env` | `production` | `production`, `sandbox` or `xcode` |
| `from`, `to` | last 30 days ending today | Inclusive days (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in the reporting time zone; at most 400 days apart |

- **Day**: a calendar day in the configured `timezone`.
- **User**: an anonymous `install_id`. A reinstall is a new user.
- **Active**: had any event that day (a row in `daily_active`).
- **Truly new user**: an install whose first-seen day equals its first App Store download day (`installs.acquired_at`, from `AppTransaction`). People who installed before the app shipped the SDK are not new.
- **Money**: in the base currency. Revenue from App Store notifications is the customer price converted at the day's rate (before Apple's commission); `portfolio` uses App Store Connect proceeds (after commission and taxes). A transaction with price 0 is a free-trial start, not a sale.
- Percentages have one decimal; `null` means no data or not yet observable.

## active_users

> Daily DAU (distinct install_ids with any event that day), WAU (trailing 7 days including the day), MAU (trailing 30 days), stickiness DAU/MAU, and the number of truly new users that day (first download day = first seen day)

Extra parameters: none.

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `summary` | `days`, `avg_dau`, `users_in_range` (distinct active users in the range), `new_users` (truly new users in the range) |
| `daily` | `day`, `dau`, `wau`, `mau`, `new_users`, `stickiness_pct` |

## activity_days

> As of the `to` day: distribution of how many days each user was active in the last 7 days (L7) and last 28 days (L28); answers "do users come back every day?"

Extra parameters: none; only `to` matters.

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `l7` | `active_days_in_7` (1 to 7), `users`, `share_pct` (of users active in the last 7 days) |
| `l28` | `active_days_in_28` (buckets `1`, `2-3`, `4-7`, `8-14`, `15-27`, `28`), `users`, `share_pct` (of users active in the last 28 days) |

## retention

> Retention of truly new users grouped by first seen day (by the Monday of the first seen week when cohort=week): Dn = share active on exactly day n after the first seen day; within_7d / within_30d = share that came back at least once within n days; cells not yet observable are empty

Extra parameters: `cohort=week` groups cohorts by week (Monday); default is per day. `from`/`to` select the cohorts' first-seen days.

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `cohorts` | `cohort_day`, `new_users`, `d1_pct`, `d3_pct`, `d7_pct`, `d14_pct`, `d30_pct`, `within_7d_pct`, `within_30d_pct`; a final row `all` aggregates every cohort |

A cell is `null` when day n has not arrived yet for anyone in the cohort; the denominators count only users whose day n has arrived.

## returning

> Daily active users split into new / returning (not first seen that day) / resurrected (inactive for >= 7 consecutive days before); plus, as of `to`, churned (last active >= 14 days ago) and at-risk (7-13 days) user counts

Extra parameters: none. "New" here means the user's first active day (not necessarily a truly new user).

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `summary` | `users_ever`, `resurrected_users_in_range`, `at_risk_7_13d`, `churned_14d_plus` |
| `daily` | `day`, `active`, `new`, `returning`, `resurrected` (subset of returning) |

## module_usage

> screen.viewed by module / screen: coverage = users who used the module / active users in the range; views per user; average time on screen in seconds (from screen.left). The features table counts feature-usage events carrying a module parameter (e.g. AI analysis, OCR) by module / event / feature: users, uses and success rate

Extra parameters: none.

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `summary` | `active_users` |
| `modules` | `module`, `users`, `coverage_pct`, `views`, `views_per_user`, `avg_duration_s` |
| `screens` | `module_screen` (`module/screen`), `users`, `coverage_pct`, `views`, `views_per_user`, `avg_duration_s` |
| `features` | `module`, `event`, `feature` (first of the `feature`, `source`, `action` params), `users`, `coverage_pct`, `uses`, `uses_per_user`, `success_pct` (share of events with `result = success` among events that have a `result`) |

## funnel

> Paywall funnel split by entry context: distinct users and conversion rates for paywall.shown -> paywall.cta_tap -> purchase.started -> purchase.success; verified_sales = sales confirmed by the App Store server (price > 0), verified_trials = free-trial starts (price 0, not counted as sales)

Extra parameters: none. Events without a `context` param count as `unknown`.

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `by_context` | `context`, `shown_users`, `cta_users`, `started_users`, `success_users`, `verified_sales`, `verified_trials`, `cta_rate_pct` (cta / shown), `success_rate_pct` (success / shown) |

## revenue

> Actual revenue from App Store Server Notifications (in the base currency) split by entry context, product and storefront, plus the distribution of days from install to purchase; context comes from appAccountToken attribution, missing attribution is recorded as unattributed; sales only counts transactions with price > 0, free-trial starts with price 0 are listed separately as trials; daily is aggregated per day (reporting time zone) and only contains days with transactions

Extra parameters: none. Uses the app's `bundle_id` and Apple's environment matching `env`.

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `summary`, `by_context`, `by_product`, `by_storefront`, `daily` | `key` (`all`, the context, product ID, storefront, or day), `sales`, `trials`, `refunds`, `net` (sales minus refunds, base currency), `unconverted` (transactions without an exchange rate, excluded from `net`) |
| `days_to_purchase` | `install_day` (`1`, `2-3`, `4-7`, `8-30`, `31+`; the acquisition day is day 1), `sales` (attributed first purchases with price > 0) |

## distribution

> Distribution of active users in the range by device model, iOS version, app version, region, App Store storefront and language (latest attributes of each user)

Extra parameters: none.

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `device`, `os_version`, `app_version`, `region`, `storefront`, `language` | `value` (`(unknown)` when missing; devices use marketing names), `users`, `share_pct` |

## overview

Extra parameters:

| Parameter | Values |

## portfolio

> Portfolio dashboard: proceeds of all apps (App Store Connect sales reports, after commission and taxes, in the base currency) month to date / same period last month / last month / year to date / last 12 months; per-app comparison (proceeds, downloads, MAU); within the selected range (range=week last 7 days / month last 30 days / year last 12 months / custom uses from-to) the trend by day or month x app, revenue mix (one-time purchase / subscription / paid download) and country breakdown; plus the latest live sales feed

Covers every app in the App Store Connect account; `app` and `env` do not filter it. Requires App Store Connect sync ([app-store-setup.md](app-store-setup.md)). Report days are Pacific Time days, as Apple defines them; "month to date" ends on the newest report day.

Extra parameters: `range` = `week`, `month`, `year` (default) or `custom` (uses `from`/`to`; aggregated by month when longer than 92 days).

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `status` | `latest_report_day`, `earliest_month`, `synced`. When nothing is synced yet, only `status` and `feed` are returned |
| `kpis` | `key`, `current`, `previous`; keys: `mtd_proceeds`, `last_month_proceeds`, `ytd_proceeds`, `last_12m_proceeds`, `all_time_proceeds`, `mtd_downloads`, `mtd_paid_units`, `mtd_refunds` (previous = same days last month where present), `live_after_report` (current = real-time net amount from notifications after the newest report day, previous = number of paid transactions) |

| `feed` | `time_local`, `bundle_id`, `type`, `subtype`, `product_id`, `revenue_sign`, `amount`, `storefront`, `free` (latest 30 production notifications) |

## store_funnel

> Store conversion (App Store Connect analytics reports): impressions (unique devices) -> product page views (unique devices) -> first-time downloads; conversion rate = first-time downloads / unique impressions (same definition as App Store Connect), product page conversion = first-time downloads / unique product page views; the window ends on the latest report day, its length is the number of days in from~to, and it is compared with the preceding window of equal length; split by app, source (search / browse / app referrer / web referrer / other) and country. scope=all covers all apps, otherwise only the current app

Requires App Store Connect analytics reports. Extra parameters: `scope=all` for all apps; otherwise the app's `bundle_id`. The window ends on the latest report day (or `to`, if earlier) and is as long as `from`..`to`.

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `status` | `latest_date`, `earliest_date`, `synced`. When nothing is synced yet, only `status` is returned |

| `territories` | `territory`, `impressions_unique`, `page_views_unique`, `first_downloads`, `cvr` (top 15) |

## Single user

Not a metric but the same result shape: `GET /v1/query/user/{install_id}` / `insight user`. Definition: "Summary, activity calendar and recent events of a single anonymous user (times in the reporting time zone, newest first)". See [query-api.md](query-api.md#get-v1queryuserinstall_id).
