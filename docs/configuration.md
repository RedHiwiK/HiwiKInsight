# Configuration

A HiwiKInsight deployment is configured by one YAML file. The fully commented reference is [examples/config.example.yaml](../examples/config.example.yaml); this page lists every field as defined in `internal/config/config.go`.

## Finding the file

- `hiwikinsight serve -config PATH` (and `check-config -config PATH`).
- Without `-config`: `$HIWIKINSIGHT_CONFIG`, else `./config.yaml`.
- The container image sets `HIWIKINSIGHT_CONFIG=/etc/hiwikinsight/config.yaml`.

An empty file is valid and means "all defaults" (no apps, so nothing is accepted yet).

## Environment variables in values

Any value may reference an environment variable:

| Syntax | Result |
|---|---|
| `${NAME}` | The value of `NAME`, or an empty string when it is unset or empty |
| `${NAME:-default}` | The value of `NAME`, or `default` when it is unset or empty |

Expansion happens on the raw file text before YAML parsing. Use it for secrets (query tokens, SMTP password, App Store Connect credentials, password hashes) so the file itself can be committed or shared. Only the `${...}` form is expanded; a bare `$` (as in a bcrypt hash) is left alone.

Two process-level variables are read directly:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `HIWIKINSIGHT_CONFIG` | Default config path when `-config` is not given |
| `HIWIKINSIGHT_DATA_DIR` | Default `data_dir` when the config does not set one (the container image sets `/data`) |

## Paths

Relative paths in the file (`data_dir`, `apps[].catalog`, `app_store_connect.key_path`) are resolved against the directory that contains the config file, not the working directory.

## Validation

```bash
hiwikinsight check-config -config config.yaml
```

prints the effective settings and fails on errors. Validation is strict:

- Unknown keys are rejected (a typo is an error, not a silently ignored setting).
- `timezone` must be a valid IANA zone; `language` must be `en` or `zh`; `currency` must be three letters; `commission_rate` must be in `[0, 1)`; `reports.hour` must be 0 to 23.
- `apps[].key` must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$` and be unique; `apps[].bundle_id` is required and unique; `apps[].color` must be one of the palette names.
- Every `dashboard.users[]` entry needs a `username` and a bcrypt `password_hash` (starting with `$2`).
- `check-config` also checks that every catalog file exists.
- The server additionally refuses to start when `dashboard.insecure_no_auth` is true and `listen` is not a loopback address.

## Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `listen` | string | `:8080` | HTTP listen address, e.g. `:8080` or `127.0.0.1:8080` behind a reverse proxy |
| `public_url` | string | empty | How users and the SDK reach the server, e.g. `https://insight.example.com`. Informational; see the note below |
| `data_dir` | path | `$HIWIKINSIGHT_DATA_DIR`, else `./data` | Directory for the database `hiwikinsight.db` and the session secret `session.key`. Created if missing |
| `timezone` | IANA zone | `UTC` | Defines a "day" for every metric, report and alert |
| `language` | `en` or `zh` | `en` | Language of transaction emails, reports and alerts (the dashboard picks its own language per browser) |
| `currency` | ISO 4217 | `USD` | Base currency that revenue is converted to and stored in |
| `commission_rate` | float | `0.15` | Apple's commission used to estimate proceeds in transaction emails: `0.15` for the Small Business Program, `0.30` otherwise. `0` means "use the default" |
| `retention_days` | int | `365` | Days raw events are kept (at least 1). Derived tables are kept forever (see [privacy.md](privacy.md)) |
| `apps` | list | empty | Apps that send events and/or App Store data. See below |
| `dashboard` | object | | Web dashboard and sign-in |
| `query` | object | | Query API tokens |
| `ingest` | object | | Event ingestion limits |
| `mail` | object | | SMTP settings for all email |
| `reports` | object | | Daily and weekly reports |
| `alerts` | object | | Alert rules |
| `app_store_connect` | object | | App Store Connect API credentials |

Note: `public_url` is informational. `check-config` prints it together with the App Store notification URL to configure, and the server logs it at startup; nothing else depends on it.

## `apps[]`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `key` | string | required | Identifies the app everywhere: the SDK's `appKey`, `?app=` in the query API, `--app` in the CLI. Lowercase letters, digits, `-` and `_` |
| `bundle_id` | string | required | Links App Store Server Notifications and App Store Connect reports to the app |
| `name` | string | `key` | Display name in the dashboard, emails and reports |
| `color` | string | next free slot | Dashboard palette slot: `purple`, `teal`, `orange`, `pink`, `blue`, `violet`, `green`, `gold`. Apps without a color get the remaining slots in config order |
| `catalog` | path | none | The app's event catalog (YAML). See [event-catalog.md](event-catalog.md) |
| `products` | map | empty | Product ID to display name, used in emails, reports and the dashboard |
| `paywall_contexts` | map | empty | The SDK's purchase `context` values to display names |

The first app in the list is the default app for the query API and CLI when `app` is omitted.

Events for an app key that is not listed are rejected with HTTP 400. App Store notifications for an unknown `bundle_id` are rejected with HTTP 400.

## `dashboard`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Serve the dashboard under `/dashboard/` (and redirect `/` there) |
| `users` | list | empty | Users who can sign in: `{username, password_hash}`. Create a hash with `hiwikinsight hash-password` (minimum 8 characters) |
| `session_ttl` | Go duration | `720h` (30 days) | How long a sign-in lasts, e.g. `720h`, `24h`, `30m` |
| `insecure_no_auth` | bool | `false` | Disable sign-in entirely. Only allowed when `listen` is a loopback address such as `127.0.0.1:8080` |

Removing a user from the config invalidates that user's sessions at the next request. Deleting `session.key` in the data directory signs everyone out.

## `query`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tokens` | list of strings | empty | Tokens accepted as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on `/v1/query/*`. Empty strings are ignored. Without tokens the query API is only reachable from a signed-in dashboard session |

Generate tokens with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Use one token per client so you can revoke them independently.

## `ingest`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `daily_cap` | int | `5000` | Maximum events accepted per install per day (reporting time zone). The excess is dropped silently and still acknowledged with 202 so the SDK does not retry |

## `mail`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `smtp_host` | string | empty | SMTP server. Mail is sent only when `smtp_host` and `to` are both set; otherwise each message is only logged |
| `smtp_port` | int | `465` | `465` uses implicit TLS; any other port (usually `587`) uses STARTTLS |
| `username` | string | empty | SMTP user |
| `password` | string | empty | SMTP password; use `${SMTP_PASSWORD}` |
| `from` | string | `username` | Sender address |
| `to` | list | empty | Recipients of transaction emails, reports and alerts |

## `reports`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `daily` | bool | `true` | Send yesterday's daily report |
| `weekly` | bool | `true` | Send last week's report on Mondays |
| `hour` | int 0-23 | `9` | Hour in the reporting time zone after which reports are sent |

See [reports-and-alerts.md](reports-and-alerts.md).

## `alerts`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Run the alert checks every 5 minutes |
| `spike_users` | int | `3` | An error seen before alerts when it affects at least this many users within an hour |
| `report_stale_days` | int | `3` | Alert when the newest App Store Connect daily report is older than this many days |
| `silent_hours` | int | `48` | Alert when an app that had events in the previous 7 days sends nothing for this many hours |
| `payment_errors` | list | `[purchase, restore, products.load]` | Error ids (the `id` of `error` events) that alert on their first occurrence each day. Set `[]` to disable |

## `app_store_connect`

Sync is enabled only when all four values are present.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `key_id` | string | empty | API key ID |
| `issuer_id` | string | empty | Issuer ID |
| `key_path` | path | empty | The `.p8` private key file |
| `vendor_number` | string | empty | Vendor number from Payments and Financial Reports |

See [app-store-setup.md](app-store-setup.md).
